# üîß Vercel Deployment Fix

## ‚ùå **Issue Encountered**
```
Environment Variable "VITE_API_URL" references Secret "api_url", which does not exist.
```

## ‚úÖ **Issue Fixed**

I've updated the `frontend/vercel.json` file to remove the problematic secret reference.

### **What Was Wrong:**
The `vercel.json` was trying to reference a Vercel secret `@api_url` that doesn't exist:
```json
"env": {
  "VITE_API_URL": "@api_url"  // ‚ùå This secret doesn't exist
}
```

### **What I Fixed:**
Simplified the `vercel.json` to let you set environment variables directly in the Vercel dashboard:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist", 
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev"
}
```

## üöÄ **How to Deploy Now**

### **Step 1: Continue with Vercel Deployment**
- The error should be gone now
- Continue with your deployment process

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variable in Vercel Dashboard**
When you get to the environment variables section:

1. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://log-anomaly-api.onrender.com`
   - **Environment**: Production (and Preview if you want)

2. **Click Deploy**

### **Alternative: Skip Environment Variables for Now**
If you want to deploy immediately:
1. **Skip** the environment variables section
2. **Deploy** the app
3. **Add the environment variable later** in Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. **Redeploy** to apply the changes

## üìã **Complete Deployment Steps**

### **In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. **Import Project**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select your repository

2. **Configure Project**
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite (should auto-detect)
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory**: `dist` (auto-detected)

3. **Environment Variables** (Optional - can add later)
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://log-anomaly-api.onrender.com`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete

## üß™ **Testing After Deployment**

Your app will work even without the environment variable because of the fallback in `constants.js`:

```javascript
// This will use localhost:5000 as fallback if VITE_API_URL is not set
export const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 
                           import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 
                           'http://localhost:5000';
```

**To fix this after deployment:**
1. Go to your Vercel project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add `VITE_API_URL` = `https://log-anomaly-api.onrender.com`
3. Redeploy from Deployments tab

## ‚úÖ **Expected Results**

**Without Environment Variable:**
- ‚úÖ App deploys successfully
- ‚úÖ UI works perfectly
- ‚ùå API calls will fail (wrong URL)

**With Environment Variable:**
- ‚úÖ App deploys successfully  
- ‚úÖ UI works perfectly
- ‚úÖ API calls reach your backend
- ‚úÖ Full functionality (within backend limitations)

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**Deploy now** and add the environment variable afterward:
1. **Complete deployment** without environment variables
2. **Test that UI loads** properly
3. **Add environment variable** in Vercel settings
4. **Redeploy** to connect to your backend

This way you get your app live immediately and can fix the API connection in the next step.

üöÄ **The deployment should work now! Continue with your Vercel deployment.**
